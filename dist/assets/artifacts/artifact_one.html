            <h1>Pig with Mayor's Seal</h1>
            <p>This is a mass- produced porcelain pig with a Mayoral Crest, from around 1920. This belongs to the collection at the Limerick Museum. Between1890 and 1925 it was trendy to collect crested figurines. These were called ‘crestware’. This Pig has specific importance to Limerick not only for the crest but due to the fact that Limerick was referred to as Pigtown, as a result of the booming pork trade at the time.</p>
