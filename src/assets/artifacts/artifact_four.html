            <td>This terracotta object is called a Tree of Life, and it was made by a Mexican artist called Tiburcio Soteno. The Tree of life is in the permanent collection at the Limerick city Gallery of Art. He made it during an artistâ€™s residency at the Douglas Hyde Gallery in Dublin in  1998.  A residency means that the artist makes their art right there in the gallery and any visitors can come to see them. Tree of life sculptures like this are a specialty from Metepec, the city where the artist was from. Typically the story told in a Tree of Life is that of the Garden of Eden from the Bible.</td>
